# Dog Breed Classifier

This exercise was part of the [Udacity Deep Learning / ML nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), and involved using transfer learning with pre-trained PyTorch [VGG16](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torchvision/models/vgg.html) and [ResNet50](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect dog breeds.
